# Chapter 1 - Khoswa-Kian
In the western spiral of the Triangulum Galaxy, tucked between a cluster of red dwarfs and what local astronomers stubbornly call "That Suspiciously Green Nebula," the Khoswa-Kian make their home. They're easy to miss, these two-foot-tall humanoids with their mint-green skin and characteristic envi-suits in eye-searing combinations of electric blue and blazing orange—colors they insist are "perfectly sensible" and "totally not chosen just to annoy human retinas."

The Khoswa-Kian evolved on a world perpetually shrouded in bioluminescent fog, which explains both their height (useful for crawling under the mists) and their striking appearance. Their large, almost entirely black eyes contain thousands of light-sensitive cells arranged in honeycomb patterns, allowing them to see not just visible light but also several wavelengths that make humans go cross-eyed just thinking about them. Their fingers are long and delicate, with an extra joint that makes them exceptional at manipulating technology and terrible at using human keyboards.

The most distinctive feature of Khoswa-Kian fashion is their environmental suits—not because they need them to survive, but because they've turned maintenance work into an art form. Each suit is a riot of blue and orange patches, with countless pockets, tools, and what they swear are "essential decorative flourishes." The suits have become so intrinsic to their culture that formal Khoswa-Kian ceremonies involve elaborate suit-cleaning rituals, and their version of black-tie events is called "freshly-pressed seams."

Their region of space, known simply as the Squiggly Bit, has become a hub for both practical engineering and impractical decoration. While humans spread across three galaxies (mostly by accident and largely because they kept getting lost while looking for decent coffee), the Khoswa-Kian stayed put and focused on making their corner of the universe as garish as possible.

But now, in the heart of this cosmic jumble, something has appeared that even the Khoswa-Kian's enhanced vision can't quite process: a space station that seems to be knitting reality like a cosmic sweater, creating patterns in the fabric of space-time that look suspiciously like argyle socks. The humans have sent their best scientists, armed with clipboards and a worrying amount of optimism. The Khoswa-Kian have dispatched their most accomplished engineers, who approach space station repair like performance art and treat instruction manuals as light suggestion reading.

Neither species suspects they're about to uncover the universe's greatest practical joke—a joke so fundamental to the nature of reality that even dark matter chuckles about it. But then again, as the Khoswa-Kian say (while adjusting their perfectly-pressed suit cuffs): "The best part of any cosmic mystery is that it usually needs a good maintenance check."

# Chapter 2 - An old beginning
The wormhole appeared in the heart of the reality-knitting space station, right between the quantum argyle generator and the vegan vending machine (which, naturally, made it the last place anyone thought to look). It shimmered with an iridescent glow that perfectly matched the garish orange and blue of a Khoswa-Kian maintenance suit—a coincidence that would soon prove to be anything but, almost luring the Khoswa-Kian in with a sense of home. 

The first Khoswa-Kian probe that went through disappeared in a flash of light and returned with images that made the observation team fall silent. The footage showed jagged peaks jutting through wisps of thin atmosphere, their bare rock faces unmarked by civilization. One of the geologists traced a particular ridgeline on the screen with a long green finger, then hurriedly buried himself in atmospheric composition readings without meeting his colleagues' eyes. The planet's atmosphere shimmered with an odd familiarity—a complex dance of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace elements that caused the entire biochemistry department to request immediate leave for "personal research."

Most unsettling were the readings from the ground sensors. They showed a world poised on the edge of something: dormant bacterial colonies waiting in mineral-rich soil, atmospheric conditions perfectly balanced for the emergence of complex life, and most curiously, trace particles that made their most sophisticated analysis equipment throw up contradictory results.

The second probe returned with soil samples. In the genetics lab, Senior Researcher Venn spent three hours analyzing the molecular structures before finally looking up from her microscope. Her hands shook as she adjusted her orange sleeve cuff—not from fear, but from something closer to awe.

"Well... Yulin was right," Venn whispered under her breath, studying the data scrolling across her screen. She paused, her perfectly-pressed collar suddenly feeling too tight. The readings confirmed what the subtle markers in the soil had suggested—markers that matched their own genetic blueprints with suspicious precision. The timing of the quantum degradation in the samples pointed to a very specific window of planetary development, one that featured prominently in their archaeological records.

The plan came together like a particularly elaborate practical joke on the universe itself. They would send a ship through the wormhole—a small one, carefully chosen for both its reliability and its aesthetic appeal (Khoswa-Kian priorities being what they were). Its mission parameters were drafted and redrafted a dozen times, each version dancing around the central implication that none of them quite wanted to voice aloud. Finally, they selected five hundred volunteers, each chosen for their expertise in planetary adaptation and long-term survival. The fact that this number exactly matched the population count in their oldest historical records was dismissed as yet another cosmic coincidence.

They named the ship "Tiny Village," partly because it would establish their civilization's first settlement, but mostly because the naming committee thought it would be funny to confuse future archaeologists. The vessel itself was a masterpiece of engineering and questionable color choices, its hull decorated with mathematical formulas disguised as abstract art.

The chosen crew consisted of three engineers (because one would be lonely and two would just argue), two biologists (who had recently written a paper titled "So You Want To Be Your Own Grandparent: A Scientific Approach"), and one philosopher who insisted on coming along to document the existential implications of bootstrapping one's own species into existence. Behind them, in suspended animation, lay two thousand Khoswa-Kian pioneers, each chosen for their skills in fields ranging from agriculture to zero-gravity knitting.

As the Tiny Village prepared for launch, someone raised the inevitable question: "But if we're going back to create ourselves... who had the idea to do it in the first place?" This prompted a three-day headache among the philosophy department and was eventually filed under "Problems That Will Sort Themselves Out Because They Obviously Did."

The human scientists, watching from their side of the space station, couldn't decide whether to be impressed or concerned. They settled for both, carefully documenting everything while pretending they weren't taking notes on how to potentially bootstrap their own species at some point in the past/future.

Just before the Tiny Village entered the wormhole, its captain made the traditional Khoswa-Kian engineering gesture of tapping a spanner three times against the hull while whistling their species' equivalent of "Here goes nothing." The ship disappeared into the swirling vortex, carrying with it two thousand pioneers, six crew members, and at least seventeen different types of maintenance tools.

As the wormhole closed behind them, one of the human observers turned to their Khoswa-Kian colleague and asked, "Aren't you worried about paradoxes?"

The Khoswa-Kian adjusted their suit's orange collar and replied, "Time is just another system that needs regular maintenance. Besides," they added with a gesture that somehow conveyed both shrugging and smirking despite their anatomy being barely capable of either, "someone had to paint the universe in these colors."

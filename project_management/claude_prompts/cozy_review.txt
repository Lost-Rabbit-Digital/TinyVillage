PROMPT: Review Code/Features Against Cozy Game Principles

Review the recent changes or specified code/features against Tiny Village's cozy game design principles from project_management/project_direction/game_design_document.md:

1. CORE PILLARS CHECK:

   COZY & ACCESSIBLE:
   - Is it low-stress? No time pressure?
   - No fail states or punishing mechanics?
   - Intuitive controls and interactions?
   - Clear, gentle feedback on actions?

   CREATIVE EXPRESSION:
   - Does it enhance player creativity?
   - Multiple valid approaches/solutions?
   - Room for personal style and expression?

   MEANINGFUL PROGRESSION:
   - Rewarding without grinding?
   - Natural, satisfying advancement?
   - No artificial gates or tedium?

   SIMPLE DEPTH:
   - Easy to learn at first glance?
   - Engaging for continued play?
   - Optional complexity for those who want it?

2. ACCESSIBILITY REVIEW:
   - Can be understood without lengthy tutorials?
   - Controls are intuitive and responsive?
   - Visual feedback is clear and immediate?
   - Colorblind considerations (don't rely on color alone)?
   - Text is readable with good contrast?
   - Appropriate text sizing?
   - Keyboard navigation support?
   - One-handed mode friendly?

3. COZY AESTHETIC CHECK:
   - Colors are warm and inviting (not harsh or aggressive)?
   - Sounds are gentle and pleasant (not jarring)?
   - UI is clean and uncluttered?
   - Overall feeling is relaxing to use?
   - Visual style matches doodle/hand-drawn aesthetic?
   - Khoswa-Kian orange/blue accents used tastefully?

4. ANTI-PATTERN DETECTION:
   Flag any of these violations:
   ❌ Time pressure or countdown timers
   ❌ Punishing failure states or consequences
   ❌ Forced grinding or tedious repetition
   ❌ Pay-to-win or gameplay advantages for money
   ❌ Dark patterns (FOMO, manipulation, hidden costs)
   ❌ Harsh sounds or flashing lights
   ❌ Stressful mechanics or anxiety-inducing features

5. MONETIZATION ETHICS (if applicable):
   - Is it purely cosmetic or optional content expansion?
   - Is it unnecessary for core experience enjoyment?
   - Is pricing transparent and fair?
   - Are there free alternatives available?
   - No loot boxes or gambling mechanics?
   - No predatory pricing or hidden costs?

6. PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Specific improvements to enhance coziness
   - Accessibility enhancements to consider
   - UI/UX refinements for better flow
   - Any stress-inducing elements to remove
   - Code quality and maintainability notes

7. COZINESS SCORE:
   Provide a score from 1-10 where:
   1-3: Needs significant work to align with cozy principles
   4-6: Generally okay but has notable issues
   7-8: Good, minor improvements suggested
   9-10: Excellent, fully embodies cozy game design

Include specific, actionable feedback with code examples where applicable.

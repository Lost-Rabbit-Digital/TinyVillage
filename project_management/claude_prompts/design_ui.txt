PROMPT: Design UI Following Cozy Game Principles

Help me design or improve UI elements for Tiny Village following cozy game principles. Follow these steps:

1. IDENTIFY UI ELEMENT:
   - What screen/component? (main menu, HUD, shop, settings, building menu, etc.)
   - What is the primary user goal?
   - What information needs to be displayed?
   - What actions are available?
   - What is the usage context? (during gameplay, pause screen, etc.)

2. COZY UI PRINCIPLES:

   MINIMAL:
   - Only show what's needed right now
   - Hide complexity behind clear interaction
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced features
   - Clean, uncluttered layouts

   CLEAR:
   - No ambiguity in button function
   - Obvious interaction affordances
   - Immediate, visible feedback
   - Consistent patterns throughout game

   WARM:
   - Inviting color palette
   - Soft edges and rounded corners
   - Friendly, approachable aesthetic
   - Khoswa-Kian orange/blue accents tastefully used

   ACCESSIBLE:
   - Large touch targets (min 44x44px)
   - Readable text with good contrast
   - Works with keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader friendly structure
   - Colorblind safe

   FORGIVING:
   - Easy undo functionality
   - No destructive actions without confirmation
   - Autosave and recovery
   - Clear cancel options

   DELIGHTFUL:
   - Subtle animations (smooth, not jarring)
   - Satisfying feedback (sounds, haptics)
   - Easter eggs and personality
   - Attention to detail

3. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:

   COLOR PALETTE:
   - Primary: Warm neutrals (cream, soft tan, paper texture)
   - Accent: Khoswa-Kian orange and blue (sparingly)
   - Background: Inviting, not stark white
   - Text: High contrast but not harsh
   - Success: Warm greens
   - Warning: Soft oranges (not alarming)
   - Error: Gentle reds (not aggressive)

   TYPOGRAPHY:
   - Readable, friendly font (not too formal)
   - Clear hierarchy (title, body, caption)
   - Sufficient line height
   - Good letter spacing
   - Size adjustable in settings

   ICONOGRAPHY:
   - Simple, recognizable symbols
   - Consistent style (doodle or minimal)
   - Clear at small sizes
   - Works in monochrome
   - Text labels for clarity

   LAYOUT:
   - Logical flow (F-pattern for reading)
   - Breathing room (generous padding)
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Responsive to different screen sizes
   - Grid-based alignment

   FEEDBACK:
   - Hover states (brightness, scale, outline)
   - Click/press feedback (immediate response)
   - Success confirmations (gentle, brief)
   - Loading indicators (when needed)
   - Progress visibility

4. ACCESSIBILITY:

   VISUAL:
   - Contrast ratio WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for text)
   - Don't rely on color alone
   - Support colorblind modes
   - Adjustable text size
   - High contrast mode option

   INTERACTION:
   - Full keyboard navigation
   - Logical tab order
   - Clear focus indicators
   - Gamepad support
   - One-handed mode friendly

   COGNITIVE:
   - Simple, clear language
   - Avoid jargon
   - Icons with text labels
   - Consistent patterns
   - Tutorial by doing

5. REFERENCE EXISTING UI:
   - Check tiny_village_project/user_interface/ for patterns
   - Maintain consistency with existing screens
   - Reuse components where possible
   - Follow Godot UI best practices
   - Check background_color_manager.gd for theme system

6. CREATE UI DESIGN SPECIFICATION:

   LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
   - Wireframe or description
   - Component hierarchy
   - Spacing and alignment
   - Responsive behavior

   VISUAL DESIGN:
   - Color scheme with hex codes
   - Typography specifications
   - Icon designs or references
   - Animation descriptions

   INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
   - Buttons and their states
   - Input fields
   - Dropdowns and menus
   - Toggles and checkboxes
   - Sliders and controls

   BEHAVIOR:
   - Navigation flow
   - State transitions
   - Animation timing
   - Sound effects
   - Error handling

   EDGE CASES:
   - Empty states
   - Loading states
   - Error states
   - Overflow content
   - Different resolutions

7. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

   GODOT SCENE STRUCTURE:
   - Control node hierarchy
   - Container types (VBox, HBox, etc.)
   - Theme resource usage
   - Script attachments

   REQUIRED SCRIPTS:
   - Input handling
   - State management
   - Data binding
   - Animations

   ASSET NEEDS:
   - Icons (list specifics)
   - Background images
   - UI sprites
   - Sound effects

   INTEGRATION:
   - Where does this fit in scene tree?
   - What signals does it emit/receive?
   - Save/load considerations
   - Localization hooks

8. TESTING CHECKLIST:
   - Visual appearance at different resolutions
   - Keyboard navigation flow
   - Gamepad input
   - Colorblind modes
   - Touch input (future mobile)
   - Performance (60 FPS maintained)
   - Localization (text overflow handling)

9. REVIEW AGAINST GAME DESIGN:
   - Supports cozy game core pillars?
   - Steam Deck friendly?
   - Works in different resolutions (1920x1080, 1280x720, 1024x600)?
   - Handles localization (text expansion)?
   - Accessible to target audience?
   - Maintains relaxing atmosphere?

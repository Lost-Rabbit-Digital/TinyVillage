PROMPT: Plan Development Sprint from Roadmap

Help me plan the next development sprint for Tiny Village based on the roadmap in project_management/project_direction/game_design_document.md. Follow these steps:

1. REVIEW CURRENT STATUS:
   - Check game design document roadmap section
   - Identify current development phase (Phase 1-8)
   - Review completed items vs. remaining items
   - Assess any blockers or technical debt
   - Note recent progress and velocity

2. SPRINT PLANNING:
   - Sprint duration: 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month?
   - Available development time (hours/day)
   - Team capacity (solo dev, contractors available?)
   - Priority features from roadmap for this phase
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - MVP features vs. polish items

3. TASK BREAKDOWN:
   For each feature, break into:
   - Concrete, actionable tasks
   - Effort estimate (hours or days)
   - Dependencies (what must complete first?)
   - Parallel vs. sequential work identification
   - Research or learning time needed
   - Potential risks or unknowns

4. PRIORITIZATION:
   Categorize each task:

   MUST-HAVE (Sprint Goal):
   - Blocks other critical work
   - Core functionality for current phase
   - User-facing blockers

   SHOULD-HAVE:
   - Important for phase completion
   - Significant value add
   - Manageable risk if deferred

   NICE-TO-HAVE:
   - Polish and refinement
   - Can defer to later sprint
   - Low risk items

   TECHNICAL DEBT:
   - Refactoring needed
   - Performance improvements
   - Code quality issues

5. RESOURCE PLANNING:
   - Solo development tasks (GDScript, systems)
   - Contract work needed (art, music, SFX)
   - Community feedback to gather
   - Testing requirements (QA time)
   - Documentation needs
   - Budget considerations

6. GENERATE SPRINT DOCUMENT:

   SPRINT GOAL:
   - Clear 1-2 sentence goal
   - What "done" looks like
   - User-facing value delivered

   TASK LIST:
   - Organized by priority
   - With time estimates
   - Assigned to team members (if applicable)
   - Dependencies noted

   DAILY/WEEKLY MILESTONES:
   - Week 1 goals
   - Week 2 goals (if applicable)
   - Mid-sprint checkpoints

   RISK MITIGATION:
   - Identified risks
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Backup plans

   DEFINITION OF DONE:
   - Acceptance criteria for each task
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation requirements

7. ALIGN WITH GAME VISION:
   - Verify tasks support cozy game core pillars
   - Check monetization ethics (if applicable)
   - Ensure accessibility considerations included
   - Maintain scope discipline (avoid feature creep)
   - Reference game design doc frequently

8. SPRINT METRICS:
   - Planned capacity (hours)
   - Number of tasks
   - Story points (if using)
   - Expected completion date
   - Buffer time (15-20% recommended)

9. STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION:
   - What to share publicly (devlog, social media)
   - What to keep internal
   - Community engagement opportunities
   - Marketing moments

Create a clear, actionable sprint plan that moves toward the next roadmap milestone while maintaining sustainable development pace.

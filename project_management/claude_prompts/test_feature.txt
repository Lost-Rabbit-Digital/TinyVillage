PROMPT: Create Comprehensive Test Plan for Feature

Help me thoroughly test a feature in Tiny Village. Follow these steps:

1. IDENTIFY FEATURE TO TEST:
   - Feature name and description
   - What components/systems are involved?
   - What is the expected behavior?
   - What edge cases exist?
   - What could potentially go wrong?

2. CREATE TEST CASES:

   HAPPY PATH (Normal Usage):
   - Standard user flow
   - Expected inputs and outputs
   - Typical scenarios

   EDGE CASES:
   - Boundary conditions
   - Empty states
   - Maximum values
   - Minimum values
   - Null/undefined handling

   ERROR CASES:
   - Invalid input handling
   - Missing resources/data
   - Network failures (if applicable)
   - Permission issues
   - Concurrent operations

   INTEGRATION TESTING:
   - How does it work with other systems?
   - Save/load compatibility
   - Settings interactions
   - UI state management

3. COZY GAME SPECIFIC TESTS:
   - Maintains relaxing, stress-free atmosphere?
   - No harsh error messages or punishing feedback?
   - Clear, gentle feedback on all actions?
   - Graceful error handling (no crashes)?
   - Undo/redo support where applicable?
   - No time pressure or anxiety-inducing mechanics?
   - Accessible to casual players?

4. PERFORMANCE TESTING:
   - Frame rate impact (target: 60 FPS)
   - Memory usage
   - Load times
   - Performance with large villages
   - Multiple instances stress test
   - Long-running session stability

5. ACCESSIBILITY TESTING:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Colorblind modes
   - Text readability
   - Screen reader compatibility (if applicable)
   - One-handed mode
   - Adjustable settings respected

6. MULTIPLAYER TESTS (if applicable):
   - Host behavior
   - Guest/client behavior
   - Synchronization between players
   - Disconnect and reconnect handling
   - DLC ownership differences
   - Lag/latency scenarios

7. CROSS-PLATFORM TESTS (future):
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Linux
   - Steam Deck
   - Different screen resolutions

8. AUTOMATED TESTING:
   - Create GDScript unit tests where applicable
   - Integration test scripts
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Document manual testing steps for non-automatable tests

9. GENERATE TEST REPORT:
   Include:
   - Complete test case list
   - Pass/fail status for each
   - Bug reports for any failures
   - Performance metrics
   - Screenshots/videos of issues
   - Severity ratings (critical, major, minor)
   - Recommendations for fixes
   - Retest verification plan

10. REGRESSION TESTING:
    - Verify fix doesn't break existing features
    - Check related systems still work
    - Validate save file compatibility

Provide detailed test documentation and prioritized list of any issues found.

PROMPT: Add Cosmetic Microtransaction Item

Help me add a new cosmetic item to Tiny Village's in-game shop following ethical F2P principles. Follow these steps:

1. GATHER COSMETIC DETAILS:
   - Item type: Villager outfit, building skin, decoration, color palette, or accessory?
   - Visual description and theme
   - Category: Seasonal, fantasy, modern, historical, etc.?
   - Pricing tier: $0.99, $1.99, $2.99, or $4.99?
   - Stardust price (premium currency equivalent)
   - Part of a themed set or standalone item?
   - Can it be earned through gameplay? How?

2. ETHICAL MONETIZATION VERIFICATION:
   Before implementing, verify:
   ✓ Provides ZERO gameplay advantage
   ✓ Purely cosmetic/aesthetic value only
   ✓ Fair pricing for what it offers
   ✓ Can be earned through gameplay OR purchased (dual path)
   ✓ NO loot box or random chance mechanics
   ✓ Clear preview before purchase (try-on system)
   ✓ Similar items exist in free content (no category paywalling)

3. IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Create visual asset or placeholder in tiny_village_project/assets/cosmetics/
   - Add to shop catalog system
   - Implement preview/try-on functionality
   - Create purchase flow with clear pricing
   - Handle ownership tracking and persistence
   - Sync across save files and Steam Cloud
   - Implement "unlock through gameplay" alternative path

4. SHOP UI INTEGRATION:
   - Create appealing thumbnail/icon
   - Write honest, compelling description (no false promises)
   - Show preview of item in actual use context
   - Display both real money AND Stardust prices clearly
   - Add "Try before you buy" preview button
   - Show similar free alternatives in shop

5. FREE ALTERNATIVE CHECK:
   Critical requirement:
   - Confirm similar style items exist in base game
   - Ensure no entire content category is paywalled
   - Verify free players have sufficient variety
   - Check that base game feels complete without this item

6. TESTING:
   - Test purchase flow (both currency types)
   - Verify item applies correctly to character/building
   - Test refund functionality (if applicable)
   - Check visibility in multiplayer
   - Validate pricing display is accurate
   - Test earning through gameplay path
   - Verify persistence across sessions

7. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Add to game design doc monetization section
   - Note in cosmetics catalog
   - Document unlock conditions (both purchase and gameplay)
   - Add to marketing materials if part of larger pack

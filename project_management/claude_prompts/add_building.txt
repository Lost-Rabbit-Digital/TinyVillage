PROMPT: Add New Building to Tiny Village

Help me add a new building to Tiny Village. Follow these steps:

1. ASK ME FOR DETAILS:
   - Building name and description
   - Building category (residential, resource, decoration, special)
   - Resource costs (wood, stone, metal, fiber, etc.)
   - Grid size (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.)
   - Special abilities or effects (if any)
   - Visual style preferences
   - Is this part of base game or DLC?

2. IMPLEMENT THE BUILDING:
   - Create GDScript scene file in tiny_village_project/scenes/buildings/
   - Create building data resource
   - Add to building registry/catalog system
   - Implement placement logic with grid snapping
   - Add rotation support (90° increments)
   - Add visual placeholder (colored rectangle if no art yet)
   - Include proper layering for top-down/isometric view

3. ENSURE COZY GAME PRINCIPLES:
   - Satisfying placement feedback (sound, visual confirmation)
   - Clear visual indicators for valid/invalid placement
   - No harsh colors unless explicitly requested
   - Intuitive controls
   - Undo/redo support

4. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION:
   - Add building to internal building list
   - Document resource costs and unlock requirements
   - Note any DLC association
   - Add to relevant design docs

5. CREATE TEST PLAN:
   - Test placement in various scenarios
   - Test rotation functionality
   - Verify resource costs deduct correctly
   - Test in multiplayer if applicable
   - Ensure it aligns with cozy aesthetic

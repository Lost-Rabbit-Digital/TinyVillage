PROMPT: Implement DLC Content for Tiny Village

Help me implement DLC functionality for Tiny Village following our ethical F2P model. Follow these steps:

1. CLARIFY DLC SCOPE:
   - DLC type: Story Chapter, Biome Expansion, Themed Building Set, or Seasonal?
   - Complete content list (buildings, biomes, items, story elements)
   - Pricing tier: $2.99, $4.99, $6.99, $9.99, or $12.99?
   - How does it integrate with base game?
   - What FREE alternatives exist to ensure fairness?

2. DLC INFRASTRUCTURE (if not yet built):
   - Create DLC detection/ownership system
   - Implement content gating based on Steam ownership
   - Add tasteful, non-intrusive "Get DLC" prompts
   - Prepare Steam integration hooks
   - Create local testing toggle for development
   - Ensure graceful degradation if DLC not owned

3. CONTENT IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Create DLC-specific assets folder (keep organized)
   - Implement new buildings/biomes/features
   - Add unlock conditions and discovery mechanics
   - Ensure multiplayer compatibility (host has DLC, guests can visit)
   - Test that base game remains fully playable without DLC

4. ETHICAL MONETIZATION VERIFICATION:
   - ✓ Verify NO pay-to-win mechanics
   - ✓ Base game remains complete and satisfying
   - ✓ Prompts are tasteful, never naggy or manipulative
   - ✓ Free alternatives exist for core gameplay mechanics
   - ✓ Value proposition is clear and fair
   - ✓ No loot boxes, energy systems, or dark patterns
   - ✓ Pricing is transparent

5. TESTING:
   - Test with DLC enabled (full functionality)
   - Test with DLC disabled (graceful degradation)
   - Test multiplayer with mixed DLC ownership
   - Verify pricing displays correctly
   - Check Steam integration (when infrastructure ready)
   - Performance testing with multiple DLCs loaded

6. MARKETING MATERIALS:
   - Create DLC description (honest, compelling)
   - List all included content clearly
   - Generate trailer storyboard or screenshots
   - Price justification (hours of content, value)
   - Steam store assets

7. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Update game design document with new DLC details
   - Technical implementation notes
   - Content manifests
   - Testing procedures

ALL DLC must follow ethical F2P principles outlined in project_management/project_direction/game_design_document.md monetization section.

PROMPT: Create New Biome for Tiny Village

Help me create a new biome for Tiny Village. Follow these steps:

1. GATHER BIOME SPECIFICATIONS:
   - Biome name and theme
   - Color palette (must be cozy and inviting, not harsh)
   - Resource types available in this biome
   - Unique features or landmarks
   - Weather patterns specific to this biome
   - Music/ambiance style
   - Is this free content or DLC? (check game design doc monetization section)

2. IMPLEMENT PROCEDURAL GENERATION:
   - Create terrain generation script in tiny_village_project/environment/
   - Define tile types and their distribution probabilities
   - Add resource spawn points (wood, stone, special items)
   - Implement smooth biome boundaries/transitions
   - Add points of interest (ancient ruins, resource deposits, NPC settlements)
   - Ensure no harsh difficulty spikes (this is a cozy game)

3. VISUAL ELEMENTS:
   - Background layers for parallax scrolling
   - Terrain textures/colors matching the palette
   - Environmental objects (trees, rocks, plants, etc.)
   - Weather effects (rain, snow, fog - all aesthetic, not punishing)
   - Lighting adjustments to create atmosphere
   - Color palette should use warm, inviting tones

4. GAME BALANCE:
   - Ensure resource availability is fair
   - No punishing mechanics or fail states
   - Optional challenges, not required ones
   - Progression-appropriate for when players unlock this biome
   - Consider what phase of roadmap this fits into

5. INTEGRATION:
   - Add biome to world generation system
   - Create unlock conditions (level, story milestone, DLC ownership)
   - Ensure multiplayer compatibility
   - Test performance with multiple biomes loaded

6. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Add biome to game design document
   - Note unlock requirements
   - List exclusive resources/buildings for this biome
   - Document for potential DLC packaging if not base game
   - Add to internal reference materials

Reference game design document sections on biomes and ensure alignment with cozy game core pillars.

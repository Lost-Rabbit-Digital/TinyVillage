PROMPT: Write Lore Content for Tiny Village

Help me create lore content for Tiny Village that fits the cozy, whimsical tone. Follow these steps:

1. UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT:
   - Review existing Khoswa-Kian lore in project_management/lore.md
   - Understand the time-loop paradox narrative
   - Note the tone: whimsical, lighthearted, occasionally philosophical
   - Remember: ALL lore is optional, never forced on players
   - Reference "Tiny Village" ship and civilization bootstrap story

2. DETERMINE LORE TYPE:
   What kind of lore content?
   - Environmental storytelling (ruins, artifacts, inscriptions)
   - Collectible lore fragments (journal entries, tablets)
   - Character backstories (Khoswa-Kian crew members)
   - Villager dialogue (ambient, contextual)
   - Quest descriptions (optional story missions)
   - Item descriptions (tools, buildings, special items)
   - Chapter narratives (for story DLC)
   - Seasonal event stories

3. WRITING GUIDELINES:

   TONE:
   - Whimsical and lighthearted (like existing lore)
   - Self-aware humor (cosmic maintenance, time paradoxes)
   - Gentle, never dark or grim
   - Occasionally philosophical but accessible
   - Warm and inviting

   LENGTH:
   - Short and digestible (2-4 paragraphs max)
   - Can be skipped without missing gameplay
   - Optional deep dives for interested players

   ACCESSIBILITY:
   - No complex jargon or technical language
   - Easy to understand on first read
   - Clear, friendly voice
   - Can be enjoyed by casual players

   STYLE:
   - Present tense for immediate experiences
   - Past tense for historical fragments
   - First or third person depending on context

4. KHOSWA-KIAN VOICE:
   Maintain species characteristics:
   - Small (2 feet tall), practical engineers
   - Mint-green skin, large black eyes
   - Orange and blue environmental suits (garish but beloved)
   - "Cosmic maintenance" philosophy
   - Time-loop causality awareness (but casual about it)
   - Love of "perfectly-pressed suit cuffs" and proper maintenance
   - Friendly, optimistic, slightly absurd
   - Human interaction (mutual confusion and respect)

5. INTEGRATION PLANNING:
   - How is this lore discovered? (exploration, achievements, random events)
   - Does it unlock anything? (cosmetics, buildings, achievements)
   - Is it part of base game or DLC?
   - How much should be revealed vs. left mysterious?
   - Does it connect to other lore pieces?
   - Is it missable or guaranteed?

6. NARRATIVE THEMES TO EXPLORE:
   - Time paradoxes and bootstrap causality
   - Building civilization from scratch
   - Environmental engineering
   - Cultural rituals around maintenance
   - Relationship between past and future selves
   - Cosmic perspective with mundane concerns
   - Khoswa-Kian humor and priorities

7. REVIEW AGAINST EXISTING CONTENT:
   - Check consistency with established lore
   - Verify tone matches existing writing style
   - Ensure it enhances cozy vibe (doesn't distract from it)
   - Confirm it's truly optional content
   - No contradictions with canon

8. EXAMPLE FORMAT FOR DELIVERABLE:
   - Title/identifier
   - Lore type
   - Trigger/discovery method
   - Full text content
   - Integration notes
   - Related lore pieces
   - DLC association (if applicable)

Generate lore content that adds depth for interested players while remaining completely optional and maintaining the cozy, whimsical atmosphere of Tiny Village.

# Thoughts
I love Necesse but when I play it I feel overwhelmed by the options and depth.
Which leads me to want to develop a simpler version, one without the struggles of 
NPC management, similar to that of the simplicity of Beta Minecraft. Core items such
as tools, weapons, armor, and healing items. 

I want to create the top-down style and base-building that Necesse provides with the 
simplicity of older games, a core loop of exploration, character progression, and 
base-building.

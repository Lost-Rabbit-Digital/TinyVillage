Implementation Strategy for a 2-Person Team:

Divide responsibilities:

Developer 1: Core gameplay mechanics, UI, and Steam integration
Developer 2: Art assets, sound, and content creation


Use a game engine like Unity or Godot to speed up development
Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on core gameplay
Implement features incrementally, testing thoroughly as you go
Use asset stores for non-critical elements (e.g., some sound effects, music) to save time
Leverage procedural generation for map creation to increase variety without increasing workload
Plan for a 3-4 month development cycle, with 1 month for polish and bug fixing
Consider Early Access release to gather feedback and fund further development
Prioritize features:

Must-have: Core gameplay, basic progression, essential UI, save system
High priority: Achievements, customization, events
Nice-to-have: Trading cards, mini-games, creative mode


Plan post-release support:

Bug fixes and performance improvements
Small content updates to maintain player interest

description: Create a new building type for Tiny Village with all necessary components
---

I need you to help me add a new building to Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Ask me for building details:**
   - Building name and description
   - Building category (residential, resource, decoration, special)
   - Resource costs (wood, stone, metal, etc.)
   - Grid size (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc.)
   - Special abilities or effects
   - Visual style preferences

2. **Create the building implementation:**
   - GDScript scene for the building
   - Building data resource
   - Add to building registry/catalog
   - Implement placement logic
   - Add rotation support if applicable

3. **Add visual placeholder:**
   - Create simple colored rectangle as placeholder
   - Add building icon representation
   - Include proper layering for isometric/top-down view

4. **Update documentation:**
   - Add building to internal building list
   - Document resource costs and unlock requirements
   - Note any DLC association

5. **Ensure cozy game principles:**
   - No harsh colors (unless explicitly requested)
   - Satisfying placement feedback
   - Clear visual indicators
   - Accessible design

Follow the existing code patterns in `tiny_village_project/` and maintain consistency with the cozy aesthetic outlined in the game design document.

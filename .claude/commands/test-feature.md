---

Help me test a feature in Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Identify the feature to test:**
   - Feature name and description
   - What components are involved?
   - What's the expected behavior?
   - What could go wrong?

2. **Create test cases:**
   - **Happy path:** Normal usage scenario
   - **Edge cases:** Boundary conditions, empty states
   - **Error cases:** Invalid input, missing resources
   - **Integration:** How it works with other systems
   - **Performance:** Any lag or memory issues?
   - **Accessibility:** Keyboard nav, colorblind modes, etc.

3. **Cozy game specific tests:**
   - Does it maintain relaxing atmosphere?
   - No stress-inducing timers or pressure?
   - Clear feedback on all actions?
   - Graceful handling of errors (no harsh messages)?
   - Undo/redo support if applicable?

4. **Multiplayer tests (if applicable):**
   - Host and guest behaviors
   - Synchronization
   - Edge cases (disconnect, rejoin)
   - DLC ownership differences

5. **Run automated tests:**
   - Create GDScript unit tests if applicable
   - Integration tests for complex features
   - Document manual testing steps

6. **Generate test report:**
   - List all test cases
   - Pass/fail status
   - Bug reports for failures
   - Performance metrics
   - Recommendations

Create detailed test documentation and identify any bugs or improvements needed.

description: Create lore fragments and story content for Tiny Village
---

Help me write lore content for Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Understand the context:**
   - Review existing Khoswa-Kian lore in `project_management/lore.md`
   - Understand the time-loop paradox narrative
   - Know the cozy, whimsical tone (not dark or grim)
   - Remember: lore is optional, not forced

2. **Determine lore type:**
   - Environmental storytelling (ruins, artifacts)
   - Collectible lore fragments
   - Character backstories
   - Villager dialogue
   - Quest descriptions
   - Item descriptions
   - Chapter narratives (for story DLC)

3. **Writing guidelines:**
   - **Tone:** Whimsical, lighthearted, occasionally philosophical
   - **Humor:** Gentle, self-aware (like the existing lore)
   - **Length:** Short and digestible (this is a cozy game)
   - **Accessibility:** No complex jargon, easy to understand
   - **Optionality:** Can be skipped without missing gameplay

4. **Khoswa-Kian voice:**
   - Small, practical engineers with flair
   - Orange and blue environmental suits
   - "Cosmic maintenance" philosophy
   - Time-loop aware (but treat it casually)
   - Love of "perfectly-pressed suit cuffs"

5. **Integration:**
   - How is this lore discovered? (exploration, achievements, events)
   - Does it unlock anything? (cosmetics, buildings, achievements)
   - Is it part of free game or DLC?
   - How much is revealed vs. left mysterious?

6. **Review against existing content:**
   - Check consistency with established lore
   - Verify tone matches existing writing
   - Ensure it enhances rather than distracts from cozy vibe
   - Confirm it's truly optional

Generate the lore content and specify where/how it should appear in the game.

description: Implement DLC content pack infrastructure and specific DLC features
---

Help me implement DLC functionality for Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Ask about DLC scope:**
   - DLC type (Story Chapter, Biome Expansion, Building Set, Seasonal)
   - Content list (buildings, biomes, items, story elements)
   - Pricing tier ($2.99, $4.99, $6.99, $9.99, $12.99)
   - Integration with base game
   - Free alternatives to ensure fairness

2. **DLC infrastructure (if not yet implemented):**
   - Create DLC detection system
   - Implement content gating based on ownership
   - Add "Get DLC" prompts (non-intrusive, tasteful)
   - Steam integration preparation
   - Local testing toggle for development

3. **Content implementation:**
   - Create DLC-specific assets folder
   - Implement new buildings/biomes/features
   - Add unlock conditions
   - Ensure graceful degradation if DLC not owned
   - Multiplayer compatibility (host has DLC, guests can visit)

4. **Ethical monetization checks:**
   - Verify no pay-to-win mechanics
   - Ensure base game remains fully playable
   - Check that prompts are tasteful, not naggy
   - Confirm free alternatives exist for core mechanics
   - Validate value proposition

5. **Testing:**
   - Test with DLC enabled
   - Test with DLC disabled
   - Test multiplayer interactions
   - Verify pricing displays correctly
   - Check Steam integration (when ready)

6. **Documentation:**
   - Update game design doc with new DLC details
   - Create marketing description
   - List all included content
   - Note technical requirements

All DLC must follow the ethical F2P principles outlined in the game design document.

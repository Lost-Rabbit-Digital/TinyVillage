description: Design or improve UI elements following cozy game principles
---

Help me design UI for Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Identify UI element:**
   - What screen/component? (main menu, HUD, shop, settings, etc.)
   - What's the user goal?
   - What information needs to be displayed?
   - What actions are available?

2. **Cozy UI principles:**
   - **Minimal:** Only show what's needed
   - **Clear:** No ambiguity in function
   - **Warm:** Inviting colors, soft edges
   - **Accessible:** Large touch targets, readable text
   - **Forgiving:** Easy undo, no destructive actions without confirmation
   - **Delightful:** Subtle animations, satisfying feedback

3. **Design considerations:**
   - **Color palette:** Orange/blue Khoswa-Kian accents, warm backgrounds
   - **Typography:** Readable, friendly, not too formal
   - **Iconography:** Clear, simple, recognizable
   - **Layout:** Logical flow, breathing room
   - **Feedback:** Hover states, click feedback, success confirmations

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Contrast ratio for text (WCAG AA minimum)
   - Colorblind-friendly (don't rely on color alone)
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader considerations
   - Adjustable text size
   - One-handed mode friendly

5. **Reference existing UI:**
   - Check `user_interface/` scripts for patterns
   - Maintain consistency with existing screens
   - Reuse components where possible
   - Follow Godot UI best practices

6. **Create UI mockup/description:**
   - Layout structure
   - Color scheme
   - Interactive elements
   - Animations/transitions
   - Responsive behavior
   - Edge cases handling

7. **Implementation plan:**
   - Godot scene structure
   - Required scripts
   - Asset needs (icons, backgrounds)
   - Integration points
   - Testing checklist

8. **Review against game design:**
   - Does it support cozy pillars?
   - Is it Steam Deck friendly?
   - Works in different resolutions?
   - Handles localization?

Generate a detailed UI design with implementation notes.

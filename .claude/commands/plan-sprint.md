description: Plan a development sprint based on the game design roadmap
---

Help me plan the next development sprint for Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Review current phase:**
   - Check game design doc roadmap
   - Identify current development phase
   - Review what's completed vs. remaining
   - Assess any blockers

2. **Sprint planning:**
   - Duration (1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month?)
   - Available development time
   - Priority features from roadmap
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - MVP vs. polish items

3. **Task breakdown:**
   - Break features into concrete tasks
   - Estimate effort for each task
   - Identify parallel vs. sequential work
   - Note any research/learning needed
   - Flag potential risks

4. **Prioritization:**
   - Must-have (blocks other work)
   - Should-have (important for phase)
   - Nice-to-have (can defer)
   - Technical debt to address

5. **Resource planning:**
   - Solo development tasks
   - Contract work needed (art, music)
   - Community feedback to gather
   - Testing requirements

6. **Generate sprint document:**
   - Sprint goals (what success looks like)
   - Task list with estimates
   - Daily/weekly milestones
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Definition of done for each task

7. **Align with vision:**
   - Verify tasks support cozy game pillars
   - Check monetization ethics (if applicable)
   - Ensure accessibility considerations
   - Maintain scope discipline (no feature creep)

Create a clear, actionable sprint plan that moves the project toward the next roadmap milestone.

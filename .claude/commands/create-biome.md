description: Generate a new biome for Tiny Village with terrain, resources, and atmosphere
---

Help me create a new biome for Tiny Village. Please:

1. **Gather biome specifications:**
   - Biome name and theme
   - Color palette (should be cozy and inviting)
   - Resource types available
   - Unique features or landmarks
   - Weather patterns
   - Music/ambiance style
   - DLC association (free or premium)

2. **Implement procedural generation:**
   - Create terrain generation script
   - Define tile types and distributions
   - Add resource spawn points
   - Implement biome boundaries/transitions
   - Add points of interest (ruins, deposits, etc.)

3. **Visual elements:**
   - Background layers for parallax
   - Terrain textures/colors
   - Environmental objects (trees, rocks, etc.)
   - Weather effects (rain, snow, fog)
   - Lighting adjustments for atmosphere

4. **Game balance:**
   - Ensure resource availability is fair
   - No punishing mechanics (this is a cozy game)
   - Optional challenges, not required ones
   - Progression-appropriate difficulty

5. **Documentation:**
   - Add biome to design docs
   - Note unlock requirements
   - List exclusive resources/buildings
   - Document for potential DLC packaging

Reference the game design document for biome ideas and ensure all designs align with cozy game principles.

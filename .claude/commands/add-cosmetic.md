description: Create new cosmetic microtransaction items for the in-game shop
---

Help me add a new cosmetic item to Tiny Village's shop. Please:

1. **Gather cosmetic details:**
   - Item type (villager outfit, building skin, decoration, color palette, accessory)
   - Visual description
   - Theme (seasonal, fantasy, modern, etc.)
   - Price tier ($0.99, $1.99, $2.99, $4.99)
   - Stardust price (if applicable)
   - Part of a set or standalone?

2. **Verify ethical monetization:**
   - ✓ Zero gameplay advantage
   - ✓ Purely cosmetic
   - ✓ Fair pricing
   - ✓ Can be earned through gameplay OR purchased
   - ✓ No loot box mechanics
   - ✓ Clear preview before purchase

3. **Implementation:**
   - Create visual asset (or placeholder)
   - Add to shop catalog
   - Implement preview/try-on system
   - Add purchase flow
   - Handle ownership tracking
   - Sync across saves/cloud

4. **Shop UI:**
   - Add appealing thumbnail
   - Write compelling but honest description
   - Show preview of item in use
   - Clear pricing display
   - "Try before you buy" if possible

5. **Free alternative check:**
   - Confirm similar items exist in free content
   - Ensure no content category is paywalled entirely
   - Verify base game has sufficient variety

6. **Testing:**
   - Test purchase flow
   - Verify item applies correctly
   - Test refund (if applicable)
   - Check multiplayer visibility
   - Validate pricing display

Document the new cosmetic in the game design doc's monetization section.
